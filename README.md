# Garden Generator

A  Houdini Digital Asset to quickly configure simple yet aesthetically believable garden with a flexible user interface giving the user option to use the default garden provided, generate a garden using Voronoi pattern or create a garden as per his/ her choice. The garden uses five primitives which can be used as it is or could be traded with a higher level geometry per the requirement. To start with the user is given three options to choose from:

1. Default Garden  
2. Voronoi Map Garden  
3. Make Your Own Garden

Default and Voronoi Map Garden are partly pre designed with controls of distributed assets residing with the user. Make Your Own Garden on the other hand provides user the sole control to design the garden per his/her liking.
